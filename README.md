## 💡Hi, this is Joshua but most people call me Josh. I’m a rising computer science junior at Metropolitan State University, and a production engineering fellow at MLH.
### 🧠 I'm passionate about problem solving, and learning new techniques to help conquer any obstacles I'm opposed with.
### 🐍 I have experience programming in Java, Python, and HTML. 
### 📔 Additionally, I have knowledge of bash scripting which I've used to automate commands.
### :zap: I'm also into video games, sneakers, and anime.
