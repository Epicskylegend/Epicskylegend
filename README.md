## 💡Hi, this is Joshua but most people call me Josh. I’m a senior computer science student at Metropolitan State University, and a former production engineering fellow at MLH.
### 🧠 I love solving ambigious problems and learning new techniques to help conquer any obstacles I'm opposed with.
### 🐍 I have experience programming in Java, Python, C#, SQL, and HTML. 
### 📔 Additionally, I have knowledge of bash scripting which I've used to automate command to push code into production.
### 🎮 I'm also into video games, sneakers, and music.
