## Hi, this is Joshua but most people call me Josh. I’m a rising computer science junior at Metropolitan State University, and a production engineering fellow at MLH.
### I'm passionate about problem solving, and learning new techniques to help conquer any obstacles I'm opposed with.
### I have experience programming in Java, Python, and HTML. 
### Additionally, I have knowledge of bash scripting which I've used to automated commands and I follow some of the industry's best practices. 
### :zap: I'm also into video games, sneakers, and anime.
